    <h2 id="general">General Interests</h2>
    <p>My main interests are Fencing, making music, and going to the gym.</p>
    <p>
        Fencing has been a part of my life since I was 11 years old. I was
        introduced to the sport through a Saturday program for inner-city youth,
        but as I continued to indulge myself in the sport, I began competeing in
        regional and national competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I began writing song lyrics when I was a Junior in high school. Although 
        it has only been about three years since I started, I feel that I have made
        significant improvements over the years, and am excited to see how far I can go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, I began going to the gym because one of my closest friends invited me
        to work out with him. I enjoyed it, and when we both entered college, I asked him
        to share his workout routine with me. Since then I have made a good amount of progress,
        and whenever my friend is back in town we go to the gym together.
